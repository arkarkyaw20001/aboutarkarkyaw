		          I'm studies piano skill, It's have passed more than one year. It's hard to put the joy of making music on the piano into words, but this difficulty hasn't stopped many great minds from trying! To celebrate the beauty of this grand instrument, we put together this collection of wise words and quotes about piano. My the one of favorite is only piano. Color is the deyboard, the eyes are the harmonies, the soul is the piano with many strings. The artist is the hand that plays, touching one key or another, to cause vibrations in the soul. Pianos, unlike people, sing when I give them my every growl. They know how to dive into the pit of my stomach and harmonize with my roars when I've split myself open. And when they see me , guts shining, brain pulsing, heart right there exposed in a rhythm that beats need need, need need, need need, piianos do not run. And so she plays"Francesca Lia Block". The piano keys are black and white, but they sound like a million colors in your mind. Without a piano i don't know how to stand, don't know what to do with my hands. I'm an interpreter of stories. When I perform it's like sitting down at my piano and telling fairy stories. Sometimes I can only groan, and suffer, and pour out my despair at the piano. I write to become immortal, or because the piano happens to be open, or I've looke into a pair of beautiful eves.
